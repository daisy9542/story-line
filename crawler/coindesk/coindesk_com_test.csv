Bitcoin  Crypto stocks are also taking a hit, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRLC) all down 2%-3%, and bitcoin miners such as Bitdeer (BTDR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), HIVE (HIVE) and Hut 8 (HUT) losing 6%-7%. The market move came as President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. could soon get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump  posted  on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but he is safe there - we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.” Trump also called for Iran to surrender unconditionally, and for residents of Tehran to evacuate the city. The national security council was convened, according to the White House, and Trump himself cut short a G7 summit to focus on the issue. Odds of U.S. military action against Iran before July have  soared  to 65% on Polymarket. “The sudden and severe escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict introduced a significant geopolitical risk premium, prompting an immediate flight from risk assets across the board, to which crypto has not proven immune,” said Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, Chief Investment Officer at XBTO. “The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard; any credible de-escalation in the Middle East could serve as a significant risk-on catalyst, while a further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets,” he added. Matteo Greco, senior analyst at Finequia, shared the same sentiment, adding that the war could end up having significant consequences on the U.S. economic outlook. “Should Israeli military actions impact Iran’s oil production, a spike in oil prices could follow, fueling renewed inflationary pressures,” Greco said."

This marks IG's first offering of crypto exposure through spot trading of bitcoin  The company's crypto service has previously been confined to derivatives products in the form contracts for difference (CFD).  IG has teamed up with U.S.-based crypto-focused fintech firm Uphold to build crypto trading into its existing platforms that customers currently use for dealing shares, FX, commodities and derivatives.  This may demonstrate the increasing integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and digital assets that investors and traders now expect to see. The London-based firm's move also coincides with the ongoing development of the U.K.'s plans to establish a regulatory regime for the crypto industry. The government  published two consultation papers in April  on draft legislation for activities such as crypto trading and stablecoin issuance. IG shares are  around 0.25% higher on the day  at the time of writing, compared to the FTSE 100 index which is unchanged.

Bitcoin  A check at traditional markets shows that risk appetite has returned after last week's jitters on Israel and Iran launching missiles. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes bounced 0.9% and 1.4%, while safe haven gold declined 1.5%. Crypto stocks also joined the surge. Coinbase (COIN) and Circle (CRCL) closed the day 7.7% and 13% in the green. Among bitcoin miners, Bitdeer (BTDR) and Hut 8 (HUT) gained 6.9% and 5.6% respectively. Remarkably, one of the only equities in the red was Strategy (MSTR), which lost almost 0.2%, while rival bitcoin treasury companies Metaplanet rose 25% on the Japanese stock market. Positive crypto-related news added further fuel to today's rally: JPMorgan has filed a trademark application for a product that seeks to offer digital asset services such as trading, exchange, payment services and issuance. Meanwhile, asset manager Purpose is set to launch its spot XRP exchange-traded fund in Canada as momentum for altcoin-focused ETFs grows. While today's altcoin outperformance may have inspired some traders' hope for an imminent alt season, Nansen research analyst Nicolai Søndergaard poured cold water on such expectations. It's still bitcoin that's leading the market, he said, with strength often tracing back to the largest crypto's performance. ""BTC has mostly served as a trigger for altcoins,"" Søndergaard. ""Some alts also do well. BTC breaks an ATH? The market likes that."" Some profits from BTC's rise to fresh record high may have trickled down to other cryptos, while some sectors such as DeFi have enjoyed short-term bursts of outperformance. ""These have, however, not been prolonged runs for alts, and looking at the grand scheme of things, most alts have been bleeding for some time,"" he said. The focus is still very much on BTC."" Bitcoin's strong rebound from Friday's low could bode well for the crypto market. Bitfinex analysts noted that the sentiment index Fear and Greed Index dropped into “Fear” territory last week, while Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume showed aggressive selling. ""This behavior, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation-style setups that often mark local bottoms,” the analysts said. ""If BTC can hold the $102,000-$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery."" From a macro lens, attention is squarely on the Federal Reserve and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference. Investors overwhelmingly expect the Fed to keep benchmark rates steady this week and the following meeting in July, according to the  CME FedWatch tool , market participants will focus on Powell's remarks about clues on how policymakers navigate inflation and job market pressures. ""Powell’s tone, not the rate decision, will drive volatility,"" digital asset analytics firm Swissblock said in a Monday note. ""Expect whiplash trading across commodities, yields and risk assets."""

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies  whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing among other things a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally.  Once the act is passed, Bernstein said it expects ""stablecoins to evolve from the money rail of crypto to the money rail of the internet."" The act, whose full name is Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, is designed to bring stablecoin innovation back to the country, the report noted, adding that it gives a head start to U.S. regulated issuers. It mandates federal regulation for stablecoins with a market cap of over $10 billion with the potential for state regulation if it aligns with federal rules. The bill treats stablecoins as digital cash, and its intent is to drive wider mainstream adoption for payments beyond just using these cryptocurrencies as a settlement currency for digital assets, the report said. The GENIUS Act ""makes it prohibitive for non-financial public companies to become stablecoin issuers,"" Bernstein said, noting recent reports that said  Amazon and Walmart  were exploring using these cryptocurrencies. If e-commerce and tech platforms want to adopt these cryptos they will likely have to work with regulated U.S. issuers rather than issuing their own stablecoins, the report added.

A key indicator suggests that bitcoin's  This indicator is based on the gap between the bollinger bands, which are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-week simple moving average of the cryptocurrency's price. When the gap widens, it indicates that the market is more active and volatile – a phenomenon historically observed ahead of significant upward moves in BTC. When the gap narrows, it indicates less activity. The gap, also known as the bollinger band spread, could soon widen in a positive sign for the bulls, as the MACD histogram linked to the same gap has turned positive. Using the spread between the bollinger bands as input in the MACD histogram generates bullish or bearish volatility signals, identifying periods of turbulence and calm. Traders typically use the indicator to detect trend reversals in prices. The upper pane displays bitcoin's weekly open, high, low, and close (per UTC) in candlestick format. The middle pane displays the spread, or the gap between the bollinger bands, with the MACD linked to the spread in the lower pane. The MACD has now flipped positive, indicating a renewed widening of the spread or volatility boom ahead. By default, volatility is price-agnostic, meaning an impending activity could be bullish or bearish. That said, a closer look at the above chart reveals that previous positive crossovers of the MACD (marked by vertical lines) presaged major bull runs, including the late 2020 and late 2024 price rallies. Let's see if history repeats itself."

Price has since recovered into a narrow $3.00–$3.05 consolidation band, though momentum remains fragile. Lower highs continue to form, suggesting that sellers are still in control unless bulls can reclaim levels above $3.05 with conviction. The sharp move follows a wave of broader crypto weakness and a brief spike in BTC prices tied to U.S. inflation data earlier this week. While the macro backdrop remains uncertain, SUI’s price behavior appears primarily technical: the $3.20 breakdown triggered cascading stop-losses and panic selling, while psychological support near $3.00 has temporarily stemmed the decline. Volume patterns suggest cautious accumulation, with a notable spike at 14:00 UTC when over 1.2 million tokens changed hands. However, unless buyers can reclaim key resistance levels, the current bounce may prove short-lived. A confirmed close above $3.05 would be the first step toward invalidating the current downtrend.

""Our price targets generally increased due to higher bitcoin prices and improving mining profitability,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. JPMorgan said it tweaked the price targets to reflect a 24% increase in the bank's spot bitcoin assumption and a 9% increase to its network hashrate estimate. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a  proof-of-work  blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.

Bitcoin  Risk assets in general got off to a poor start Thursday as President Trump threatened renewed tariff measures as the early July deadline for trade deals begins to get near. In addition, with nuclear negotiations with Iran not going well, there were boosted fears of Israeli strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.  “Look, there’s a chance of massive conflict,” Trump  told  reporters at the White House on Thursday. “We have a lot of American people in this area, and I said, we’ve got to tell them to get out, because something could happen soon, and I don’t want to be the one that didn’t give any warning and missiles are flying.” “I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen,” Trump said about Israel potentially striking Iran. He stated that he had advised against an attack while negotiations were ongoing. While U.S. stocks were able to shake off the headlines and close with modest gains, cryptos weren't so lucky. The rally in risk assets — crypto included — over the past several weeks has taken place amid a U.S. Federal Reserve seemingly determined not to ease monetary policy for the foreseeable future. And yet, there continue to be signs that weak economic data may soon force the Fed's hand — a far slowed pace of employment gains and weaker inflation numbers among them. Two more data points arrived Thursday in May's Producer Price Index, which came in softer than forecast on both the headline and core levels, and initial jobless claims, which unexpectedly matched last week's multi-month high of 248,000. Continuing jobless claims rose to 1.956 million, the third consecutive gain and the highest level since November 2021. President Trump continued his crusade to goad Fed Chair Jerome Powell into a more dovish posture,  calling him a ""numbskull"" for not cutting rates . ""I may have to force something,"" threatened Trump. Powell's term as Fed boss doesn't end until 2026 and the president had previously said firing him prior to that was not an option."

For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see  CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its Thursday business day,  ETH is trading at $2,770. ETH is up almost 11% this month, according to CoinDesk market data, outperforming BTC, which rose 5%. Part of this could be because of institutional trading demand, and the fact that it's overtaken BTC in derivatives markets as sophisticated investors increasingly bet on ETH’s structural growth and role as a gateway between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi), OKX Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Ethereum is overshadowing BTC on our perpetual futures market, with ETH accounting for 45.2% of trading volume over the past week. BTC, by comparison, sits at 38.1%,"" Lai said. This is a  similar finding to what's occurring on Derebit , CoinDesk recently reported. That's not to say that institutions have taken a disinterest in BTC. Far from it. A  recent report from Glassnode  shows that despite  BTC's recent volatility , institutions are happily buying up the dips. Long-term holders (LTHs) realized over $930 million in profits per day during recent rallies, Glassnode wrote, rivaling distribution levels seen at previous cycle peaks. Yet, instead of triggering a cascade of selling, the LTH supply actually grew. “This dynamic highlights that maturation and accumulation pressures are outweighing distribution behavior,” Glassnode analysts wrote, noting that this is “highly atypical for late-stage bull markets.” Neither, however, are immune to geopolitical risk or  black swan events like the Trump-Musk blowout. These episodes serve as reminders that sentiment can shift quickly, even in structurally strong markets. But beneath the surface-level volatility, institutional conviction remains intact. ETH is emerging as the vehicle of choice for accessing regulated DeFi, while BTC continues to benefit from long-term accumulation by institutions via ETFs. ""Macro uncertainties remain, but $3,000 ETH looks increasingly likely,” Lai concluded. The stablecoin market just hit an all-time high of $228 billion, up 17% year-to-date, according to a new CryptoQuant report. That surge in dollar-pegged liquidity, driven by renewed investor confidence  showcased by the blockbuster Circle IPO , rising DeFi yields, and improving U.S. regulatory clarity, is quietly redrawing the map of where capital lives on-chain . ""The amount of stablecoins on centralized exchanges has also reached record high levels, supporting crypto trading liquidity,"" CryptoQuant reported. CryptoQuant noted that the total value of ERC20 stablecoins on centralized exchanges has climbed to a record $50 billion. Most of this growth in exchange stablecoin reserves has been a result of the increase in USDC reserves on exchanges, per their data, which have grown by 1.6x so far in 2025 to $8 billion. As far as protocols that have been a net beneficiary of all of this, Tron leads the pack. Tron's blend of fast finality and deep integrations with stablecoin issuers like Tether is credited with making it a liquidity magnet Presto Research, which recently released a similarly themed report, wrote that it notched over $6 billion in net stablecoin inflows in May, topping all other chains and posting the second-highest number of daily active users behind Solana and was the top performer in native total value locked (TVL) growth. By contrast, Ethereum and Solana bled capital,  Presto's data said. Both chains experienced significant stablecoin outflows and bridge volume losses, indicating a lack of new yield opportunities or major protocol upgrades. Presto’s data confirms a broader trend: institutional and retail capital alike are rotating toward Base, Solana, and Tron. The commonality? These chains offer faster execution, more dynamic ecosystems, and in some cases, bigger incentive programs The next generation of AI won’t just talk to us, it’ll talk to itself. As autonomous agents grow more capable, they'll increasingly handle tasks end-to-end: booking flights, sourcing data, even commissioning other bots to complete subtasks. But there’s a problem: right now, these AI agents are trapped in silos and they need crypto to get them out. In a recent a16z Crypto essay , Scott Duke Kominers, a Research Partner at a16z Crypto and a Faculty Affiliate at Harvard, argues that today’s agent-to-agent interactions are mostly hardcoded API calls or internal features within closed ecosystems. There’s no shared infrastructure for agents to find each other, collaborate, or transact across systems. That’s where crypto comes in. Blockchains, with their open, composable architectures, offer a “forwards-compatible” way to build interoperable agent economies, a neutral substrate that can evolve alongside AI itself. Early projects like Halliday are building protocol-level standards for cross-agent workflows, while firms like Catena and Skyfire are using crypto to enable autonomous agents to pay each other without a human being needed. Coinbase has even stepped in to support infrastructure efforts here. If these rails take hold, blockchains won’t just be financial infrastructure; they’ll be the back-end of an open AI economy, where agents transact, coordinate, and enforce user intent transparently. The message is clear: if AI agents are the future of productivity, crypto is the infrastructure that makes them play nice. Gaming maintains its lead as the dominant category in the distributed app (dAPP) ecosystem, even as its market share continues to slip,  according to a new report from DappRadar . The latest data from DappRadar shows gaming’s dominance fell for the second consecutive month, from 21% in April to 19.4% in May. Daily user activity remains relatively stable, hovering around 4.9 million unique active wallets, yet the sharp decline in investment paints a more troubling picture: venture funding for gaming projects plummeted to just $9 million in May, down sharply from over $220 million monthly at the end of 2024. ""2025 so far, has been a reality check for the gaming market. Various projects that raised millions in the previous years, have now closed shop. Among them, the hero shooter Nyan Heroes, the fantasy MMORPG Ember Sword, and social deduction game The Mystery Society,"" DappRadar analysts wrote in their report. DappRadar analysts point to a fundamental flaw driving this exodus: a lack of engaging gameplay. Projects frequently prioritized tokenomics, speculative NFT launches, and marketing blitzes, often sidelining critical gameplay testing and development. Without fun and replayable mechanics at their core, even heavily funded Web3 games have struggled to maintain player interest, suggesting that the industry's biggest challenge might simply be learning how to build great games. And this narrative is nothing new:  surveys have been saying this since 2022."

""Today’s CPI print may serve as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin - and it may be the unlock that brings this target forward by several months.

Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a 0.2% increase. Notably, the CPI for durable goods, most of which are imported or manufactured with imported content, decreased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% month-to-month (-1.3% annualized), indicating that President Donald Trump's tariffs have not yet been fully passed through to the final consumer. The annualized CPI advanced 2.4%, with core inflation matching the pace of April at 2.8%. ""This continued trend of cooling inflation strengthens the case for potential policy easing later this year. With the Fed’s June meeting approaching, the focus now shifts to how soon policymakers may respond to cooling inflation and shifting macro clarity,"" Mena said in an email to CoinDesk. The CPI report prompted traders to price in 47 basis points of Fed easing, equivalent to roughly two 25 basis point rate cuts, this year, compared to 42 basis points early this week. Further, traders priced fully priced the rate cut for October, with the September probability hovering above 70%. Mena explained that the CPI tailwind comes on the heels of several bullish catalysts, such as sovereign and institutional adoption and the impending stablecoin regulation. ""As macro clarity improves, we should see Bitcoin flows accelerate - driven by renewed institutional confidence, increased activity from Bitcoin treasuries, and the continued rollout of state-level Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) programs. These dynamics could supercharge ETF inflows and reinforce Bitcoin’s evolving role in global portfolios. Bitcoin is built for this environment,"" Mena noted. BTC changed hands at $108,440 at press time, according to  CoinDesk data ."
